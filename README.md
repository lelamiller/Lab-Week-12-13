# Overview: Bike Placement Simulation & Optimization 

In this lab, we use historical bike usage data from a bikeshare system to optimize bike placement. 
Our goal is to place bikes in a way that will maximize user satisfaction. To do so, we have created a series of functions. 
Our first function assesses the rate of arrival to the stations of our bikeshare system by using historical data. 
Our next function uses the dataframe of arrival rates at each station created by our first function to 
simulate a day of bikeshare usage. 
Our third function calls upon our arrival rates data and our simulation to repeatedly simulate days of bikeshare usage and 
then use that data to assess which stations are over or understocked with bikes. Then, the function uses this assessment to
redistribute bikes in order to maximize user satisfaction.
